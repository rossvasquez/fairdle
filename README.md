# State Fairdle

This project was inspired by my family playing Wordle and the State Fair starting. It aligned with the Supabase Week 8 Hackathon so I built the application over the one week contest and [`submitted it`](https://youtu.be/uA0cx9ikEaA) (my first time making a YouTube video). It uses Supabase to store and read daily words. It also wrote to Supabase to keep daily metrics of guess scores. It uses a Dictionary API to ensure guesses are real words.
